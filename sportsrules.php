                                    Baseball games can be wagered three different ways: Money
                                    Line, Run Line and Totals. For the Totals and Run Lines we
                                    use a 20 cent line. The favorite has the negative number
                                    next to it showing the price you have to lay to play that
                                    side and the underdog almost always has a positive number
                                    next to it showing the price you would win by playing it.
                                    Below is an example of a typical baseball game.

                                    otherwise the bet will be declared NO ACTION after the game

                                    is to bet the run-line. Every favorite will be - 1 Â½ runs
                                    and could either be plus or minus money.

                                    risking $100 to win $115.
                                    If you wager $100 on the Marlins,
                                    you have the Marlins plus 1 Â½ runs risking $135 to win $100.</p>

                                    When wagering on Total Runs (over/under) and Run Lines (run
                                    spread) the game must go 9 innings (8 Â½ if the home team is
                                    winning). If the game is suspended after 9 innings, the
                                    final score (for wagering purposes) is determined by the
                                    last full inning of play unless the home team scores to tie
                                    or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning. In which
                                    case, the winner is determined by the score when the game is
                                    called. If with this rules the game is a TIE, Run Lines and
                                    Totals count. All wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are

                                    to pitch at the time of the wager do not throw at least one
                                    pitch then the wager will be cancelled. Wagers on Total Runs
                                    and Run Lines are refunded in the event of a pitching change
                                    when the game is final.

                                    Example of a Shootout game: A game goes into overtime with a
                                    score of Team A 3 and Team B 3 (tied 3-3) and no team scores
                                    in the Overtime period. The winner of the shootouts will be
                                    awarded a goal making the final score Team A 4 and Team B 3.
                                    With this result the total for both teams combined will be
                                    7. Any 60 MINUTE RESULT wagers will be decided with the 60

                                    <li>Money line wagering on soccer offers a draw line as well as sides. In the event

                                        be graded as a win. This rule does not apply to bets placed on the spread (goal

                                    determined by the time of the goal provided by the official
                                    website not by the actual time the goal occurred. In soccer
                                    if a goal is made at the 22:35 the official time for that
                                    goal will be 23:00. For example, if the time of the Early
                                    Goal was set at 26:00 and the goal was made at 25:20 making
                                    the official time of that goal 26:00, then NO GOAL BEFORE
                                    26:00 will be the winner.

                                    same place the dead heat rule is applied as follows: The
                                    wager is reduced according to how many players tie and is
                                    then applied to the full odds with the remainder of the
                                    stake deemed as lost.
                                </p>

                                        You wager $150 at odds of +200 and 2 players tie for the
                                        same position, Half the stake is lost -$75, the other half
                                        wins and is paid the same odds. So $75 wins at +200 = $150
                                        - $75 = $75 net.

                                        +200. Please note this rule does not apply to two player

                                    wager involving him would be considered no action and will
                                    be cancelled.The exception to this rule is when the wager is
                                    made on a pool and all players have action regardless if
                                    they start or not the tournament. (ex: to win TOURNAMENT)

                                    Fred Funk - 125 Joe Durant +105 In this tournament match-If
                                    a customer picks Fred Funk, the wager is on Fred Funk to
                                    have a better record than Joe Durant. Not necessarily that
                                    Funk must win the championship but that he will end up in a
                                    better position than Durant. Both players must Tee Off in
                                    the tournament for the matchup to have action. In a
                                    two-player match-up wager, the player completing the most
                                    holes is declared the winner. If both players complete the
                                    same number of holes then the lowest score wins.

                                    Specific Rounds: Aside the odds to win the whole Tournament,
                                    we may also offer odds to win a specific round. So a
                                    customer can bet on a player to win the 3rd round only. If
                                    this is the case we will specify that the bet is for the
                                    round only and not for the whole tournament. Both players
                                    must tee off in the specified round for action. 4th round
                                    does not include playoffs

                                    rule is when a tournament is rain shortened and the final
                                    scores are determined by the PGA usually by reverting back
                                    to the last completed round.

                                    In the event that a match is decided by a Super Tiebreaker (instead of a full set), then all wagers
related to GAMES will be voided. If a match is decided this way, then the match tiebreak will
be considered to be the 3rd set, and for betting purposes, the winner will be awarded a 2-1
sets win.

                                        have in hand in order to reach an official result.
